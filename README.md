# Hello, I'm Daniel :call_me_hand:
##  *A former High School math/computer science teacher :man_teacher: turned JS Developer
### Now I'm an associate software developer :computer: at Pearson. I work in automation, specifically in Java and Selenium. I'm also working on getting certified as an AWS Developer.

#### I'm currently interested in the following things:
- Coding **Matek**, a MERN project that will serve as a database for high school math problems. This is my main goal for 2022. 
- Practicing my Gatsby skills by making a photography site for my brother.
- Recording a new EP for my band :crystal_ball: [*Crooked Numbers*](https://crookednumbers.bandcamp.com/releases) :crystal_ball:. 
- Writing a new EP for my other band :cactus: [*Desert Culture*](https://desertculture.bandcamp.com/) :cactus:.
- Something related to tech and basketball :basketball:. 


I love to meet people. I love music and sports, and movies, and basically everything. I could have a conversation with a wall. Hit me up on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/crooked_numbers/?hl=en) or email me and let's chat.  :v:

‚ö° Fun facts about me:
- I taught highschool math for 7 years in Austin, Texas. My first four years were at alternative school for students who are removed from their home campus. It was an extremely challenging and rewarding job, and I miss teaching and learning from those students. They taught me how to be patient, and how to focus on building relationships. The last 3 years teaching was at McCallum Highschool, the fine arts academy in Austin. While there I also taught AP Computer Science and coached Soccer :soccer: for 2 years. 
- I've been in bands pretty consistently since high school. By a rough count, I've been in about 8 bands. I've played shows all over Texas and the East coast, and my favorite places to play have been Austin, New York City, Providence, Washington D.C., and North Carolina. I play most instruments, but drums ü•Å are my main passion. 
-I earned my undergraduate in Sound Recording Technology from Texas State, and earned my masters in STEM Education from the University of Texas ü§ò. In 2020, I completed a Full Stack bootcamp from UT, and also was a TA for another session after finishing. 
-In January '21, I started working full time as a Web Developer at Standard Beagle, focusing on building sites with HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP.
